# Smart-Identity-Guardian
Smart Identity Guardian is a production-grade, serverless AWS solution designed to automate the KYC (Know Your Customer) process. By leveraging AI services like Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Textract, it verifies a user's identity by matching their live selfie against their government-issued ID card and extracting relevant metadata automatically.
